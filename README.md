# branch-predictor-simulator
Educational project aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of different correlating branch predictors on benchmarks


## Judge for your implementation !
This project was designed for a hardware-base event in Sharif University of Technology. We have developed a judge which checks the implementation of your predictors and then push grade in your repository. If you find it interesting as i do check [Soroush repository](https://github.com/sorousherafat/BranchPredictionSimulationJudge).

If you like to see the template check the [event organization repository](https://github.com/Hardwar2023/JavaPredictor).
